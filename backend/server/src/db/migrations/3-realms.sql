-- Triggers to update `full_path` ---------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The `full_path` column is completely managed by triggers to always have the
-- correct values according to `path_segment` and `parent`. Doing this is a bit
-- tricky.

-- The `before insert` trigger is straight forward because we know that there
-- don't exist any children yet that have to be updated. We make sure that
-- insert operations do not try to specifcy the `full_path` already since that
-- would be overwritten anyway.
create function set_full_realm_path() returns trigger as $$
begin
    if NEW.full_path is not null then
        raise exception 'do not set the full path of a realm directly (for realm %)', NEW.id;

-- However, handling updates gets interesting since we potentially have to
-- update a large number of (indirect) children. To visit all descendents of a
-- realm, we could have a recursive function, for example. But: changing those
-- descendents via `update` would cause the another trigger to get triggered! I
-- don't think one can avoid that. But we can just use this to our advantage
-- since then we don't have to do recursion ourselves.
--
-- So the idea is to just set the `full_path` of all children to a dummy value,
-- causing this trigger to get fired for all children, fixing the full path.
-- However, since the "fixing" involves querying the full path of the parent,
-- the update of the parent must be finished already before the child triggers
-- can run. In order to achieve that, we install both, `before update` and
-- `after update` triggers. Both call this function, which distinguishes the
-- two cases with `TG_WHEN`.
--
-- One last problem is that, since we set the `full_path` to fire the trigger,
-- we cannot raise an exception anymore when users incorrectly set the value.
-- Well, we can, with a hack. We just set the full path to a very particular
-- value to signal that the trigger, and not a user, set this.
